The performance of ideal and real staged primary propellant pumps and bleed-powered turbines was calculated for gas-core nuclear [rocket engines](http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com) over a range of operating pressures from 500 to 5000 atm.

This study showed that for a required engine operating pressure of 1000 atm the pump work was about 0.8 hp/(lb/sec), the specific impulse penalty resulting from the turbine propellant bleed flow as about 10 percent; and the heat required to preheat the propellant was about 7.8 MN/(lb/sec).

>"For a specific impulse above 2400 sec, there is an excess of energy available in the moderator due to the gamma and neutron heating that occurs there."

For a specific impulse above 2400 sec, there is an excess of energy available in the moderator due to the gamma and neutron heating that occurs there. Possible alternative pumping cycles are the [Rankine or Brayton cycles](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/).
